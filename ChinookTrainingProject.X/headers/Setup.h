//
// Purpose : This is the setup header for the system. It contains function
//           prototypes as well as macros and the public structure of
//           ChinookLib functions.
//
//%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
//
// Notes   : For ChinookLib to be useable, it must be cloned on your hard
//           drive so the path
//               "..\..\..\ChinookLib\ChinookLib.X\headers\ChinookLib.h"
//           references an existing file.
//
//           Function names can and should be renamed by the user to improve the
//           readability of the code.
