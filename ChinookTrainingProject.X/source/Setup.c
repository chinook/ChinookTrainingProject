// File    : Setup.c
// Author  : Frederic Chasse

//%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
//
// Purpose : This is the C file for the setup of the system. It contains the
//           initialization functions.
//
//%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
//
// Notes   : For ChinookLib to be useable, it must be cloned on your hard
//           drive so the path
//               "..\..\..\ChinookLib\ChinookLib.X\headers\ChinookLib.h"
//           references an existing file.
//
//           Function names can and should be renamed by the user to improve the
//           readability of the code. Also, the LED used for testing errors in
//           TimerInit is a LED on the MAX32 development board. Developpers
//           should test for errors by the means (hardware of software) they
//           judge are the best.
